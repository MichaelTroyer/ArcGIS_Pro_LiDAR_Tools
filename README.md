The ArcGIS Pro LiDAR Toolbox provides the tools to create digital elevation models (DEM), slope and hillshade models, intensity surfaces, elevation contours, classified polygons, and 3D point clouds from raw LiDAR data (.las/.laz/.zlas). The toolbox also provides optional tools for reclassifying ground, noise, and building classifications. The outputs of the toolbox are written to a file geodatabase (.gdb) and LiDAR Dataset (.lasd).
